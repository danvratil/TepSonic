 - looks like collections are broken now
    - CollectionsModel is not updated when CollectionBuilder finishes
    - essentially we ignore half of the artists and albums, because they are
      in VA.
        IDEA: When populating interprets, we now skip all interprets that have
        at least one album in VA. However we should only skip interprets that
        have all their albums in VA. If there interpret has at least one album
        that is not in VA, the interpret should not be ignored

 - store UI settings immediately after change, so that they are preserved when TS crashes
 - plugins: use Qt5 JSON metadata instead of .desktop files and virtual methods
 - use Qt5 version connect() in plugins
 - clean up and refactor the LastFmScrobbler plugin (const&, etc)
 - lambdas! - clean up the code where possible
 - get rid of TaskManager - implement "tasks" in respective models
 - make BookmarksManager a singleton
 - rename BookmarksBrowser to BookmarksView and move code related to Bookmarks
   from MainWindow to BookmarksBrowser
 - create FSB widget with all the buttons and input and move there all related logic
   from MainWindow
 - revisit AbstractPlugin interface - simplify?
 - revisit design of Settings - can we provide a more generic yet equally safe framework
   for configuration, reusable by plugins?
 - clean up MetadataEditor
 - clean up the translations mess in CMakeLists.txt
 - create ActionManager singleton to construct and manage actions, so that we can
   move popup menus into their respective parents, and still be able to use the actions
 - move away from .ui?
 - proper config UI for some Phonon effects
 - make MetadataEditor available from CollectionsView, too
    - support batch-changes of certain meta data
