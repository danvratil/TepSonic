 - looks like collections are broken now
    - CollectionsModel is not updated when CollectionBuilder finishes
    - essentially we ignore half of the artists and albums, because they are
      in VA.
        IDEA: When populating interprets, we now skip all interprets that have
        at least one album in VA. However we should only skip interprets that
        have all their albums in VA. If there interpret has at least one album
        that is not in VA, the interpret should not be ignored

 - store UI settings immediately after change, so that they are preserved when TS crashes
