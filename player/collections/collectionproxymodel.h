// Class CollectionProxyModel provides filter model for collections

  Class CollectionProxyModel is subclassed from QSortFilterProxyModel and provides custom special implementation
  of filterAcceptsRow() method to provide special filtering.
  The filter behaves like this: when a interpret's name matches the filter, it's displayed including all it's children and
  subchildren. If it does not match, but any of it's children matches the filter, the interpret and the album with all it's
  content are displayed. If the album does not match the filter but some of it's children does, the intepret, the album and
  the matching track are displayed.
