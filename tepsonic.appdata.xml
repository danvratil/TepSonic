 <summary>A lightweight Qt audio player</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
  TepSonic is a lightweight audio player written in Qt 5. It's goal is to be as small
  as possible while still providing many useful features.
  </p>
  <p>TepSonic can build music collections, can scrobble your tracks to Last.fm,
  retrieve song lyrics, can be controlled via MPRIS interface and more features can be
  added through it's plugin interface. But all features and plugins can be disabled at
  anytime however, keeping only a bare and simple player with minimum memory footprint.
