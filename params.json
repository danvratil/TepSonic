## About
TepSonic is just yet another audio player. It's based on Qt 5, it's simple, fast, lightweight,
but it has various features that one can expect to find in application like this. The goal is
to provide a audio player that will fit daily needs of average users, without growing to be a
huge.

## HISTORY
In 2009 I was starting with C++ and Qt and I so TepSonic was born. It went through many
iterations and it has been rewritten from scratch several times since then. I dropped
the project in mid 2011 due to lack of time (and motivation). Recently I decided to resurrect
it, fix all the bugs, solve all the design issues and essentially apply all the experience I
collected when developing various Qt and KDE apps over the two or three years.

## REQUIREMENTS
* Qt >= 5.1
* Phonon
* TagLib (http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html)
* SQLite or MySQL database for collections
* some music

## COMPILING
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ../

You may want to append `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr` to the cmake command.
