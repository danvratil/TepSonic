 TepSonic is just yet another audio player. It is based on Qt and as an audio 
 backend it uses Phonon. For retrieving metadata from media files is used TagLib. 
 This player should provide all the user-comfort functions such as collections, 
 but it should not be as big as for example Amarok. 

 Have fun with TepSonic!

1) REQUIREMENTS
----------------
 * Qt >= 4.5
 * Phonon
 * TagLib (http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html)
 * Qxt (on Linux only, see part 'Compiling')
 * SQLite or MySQL database for collections
 * some music


2) COMPILING
-------------
 
 mkdir build && cd build
 cmake ../
 make
 make install

 You may want to append -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr to the cmake command.
 
 You can force CMake to link statically against Qxt compiled from sources distributed together with TepSonic 
 by using -DFORCE_INBUILD_QXT=ON. This means that you don't need to have libQxt installed on your system. 
 Without this switch on Linux systems CMake will be looking for libqxt and will fail if does not find it. 
 On MacOS X and Windows CMake will automatically use the Qxt sources in /3rdparty/qxt.

3) BUGS
--------

 If you find something you think that is a bug, please use bugzilla on http://bugs.tepsonic.org. Also if you have any suggestions,
 ideas, fill a feature request in bugzilla or send mail to devel@tepsonic.org
