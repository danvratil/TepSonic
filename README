 TepSonic is just yet another audio player. It is based on Qt and as an audio 
 backend it uses Phonon. For retrieving metadata from media files is used TagLib. 
 This player should provide all the user-comfort functions such as collections, 
 but it should not be as big as for example Amarok. 

 This is just a development release - not everything is implementend and what is
 implemented should be consider as unstable.

 Have fun with TepSonic!
